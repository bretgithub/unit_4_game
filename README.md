# Simple RPG game aka unit_4_game

## Description
This was our first homework, advanced assignment, using jQuery, manipulating the DOM. The minimum requirements of the game are listed below:
* Pick a player
* Pick an apponent
* Each time an event (click) is performed, damage is done
* If you win, you pick another opponent
* If you lose, the game resets
* Give the user game cues displayed on the page (health, attacks, who the players are, etc.)

## Areas to improve
Where I wanted to improve the game with added logic is listed below
* Randomize the track playlist and loop
* Player increases health when the opponent loses
* Player attack increases with each successive blow (click with the attack button)
* Clean up the code to be more concise - more functions
* Reload game with a restartGame function instead of window load
* Make responsive

The exercise had us manipulate:
* jQuery
* Functions
* Classes
* Callbacks
* DOM
* Arrays
* Strings
* Debugging

## Roadmap
I intend to add more logic to the game as stated above

I want the game to be more female empowerment focused, therefore in my secomd iteration the divas will battle male counterparts who have questionable records when it comes to women (Chris Brown, Matt Lauer, Harvey Weinstein and so on), then when these foes are SLAYED, the divas win. There might be a second component when the divas battle each other but over position on the top 100 list. This change will require a visual shift to cue the user to the second round, which changes the structure of the game.

## Feedback
Open to feedback and how to finish the logic, restructure code. I also left comments on script.js on the top of the page to what I left outstanding and would like to iterate on. 

## Shoutout
Props to Joe who is one of our cohort's TAs who helped work through game logic.
